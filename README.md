## Android Chat App

End-to-End Encrypted chat app. For this project, I used Java. As the database, I used Google Firebase that ensured the data was consistent and accessible all the time. And most important, I used AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) to have end-to-end secure messaging. The information is transmitted encrypted from the app to the server, database and then decrypted by only the allowed person.
